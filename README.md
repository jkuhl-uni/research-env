# Research environment

In this project, I am making my environment aailable as a Dockercontainer, for usage with VSCode.
This is done in order to contribute to reproducibility in my research, as the exact setup that I am using is recored in the Dockercontainer. This is the base, on which I am conducting my analyses.
The TODOs, that will com in coming iterations of this container can be found [here](TODO.md).
